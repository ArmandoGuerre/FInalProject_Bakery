            <p>Welcome to Guerrero's Bakery! Our mission here at Guerrero's Bakery is to happily serve our customers delcious mexican baked goods. We are a small family owned business that specializes in making hispanic baked treats, cakes, bread, cookies, and flan! Our family decided to open this establishment to support the hispanic community and bring a new diverse twist to the southside of Saskatchewan, Canada. We've recieved and evolved all the recipes from Grandma back in Mexico. Her pride and love for baking for her kids was inspiring and therefore, the Guerrero Family wanted to carry on that love here in Canada.</p>
